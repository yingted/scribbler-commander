Hi! If you're here, you're either a member or somebody grading. if you're grading, feel free to look around; if you're a member start below.

= Using Google Code =
First thing you have to do is set yourself up for working with Subversion. Do all the googling, install a subversion client, and upload a test file so we all know you can link with the repository.

We're going to track the features we're implementing using the "issues" tab above. Go there, and click "New Issue" to add a feature we need to code. Fill in enough information so anybody else who wants to do it will know what they're working on.

Then, of available tasks, take whatever you could handle in the specified timeframe. 

== Note ==
This wiki is yours too; so please make wikipages for documentation and stuff, brainstorm, whatever. The more documented our project is, the better our reports and thus mark will be.
