#summary Stuff

= Notes =
 * Dead-reckoning -- 
  * for every type of motion, update relative position
  * we could monkeypatch - ugly implementation, beautiful interface
   * Myro will be monkeypatched to record positions
    * _updateSpeed? or some other "private" function
 * Obstacle Detection
  * How it works: sends out IR of a certain power 
  * Light reflects, at a certain power
  * reflected luminosity is inverse-square to distance, and proportional to IR reflectivity of the obstacle -- so we'll do detector testing, and record reflectivities of different obstacle surfaces -- hopefully they'll be more or less the same
 * using dead-reckoning, we can draw arcs fitting the robot's projected path, and plop dots where we see obstacles
 * FOR LATER path-editing on interface -- in case the robot derps up, it would be nice to be able to rotate the path after any point

= Milestone =
To be done by Initial project demo
