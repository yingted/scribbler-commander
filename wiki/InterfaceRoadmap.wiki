#summary Roadmap for the scribbler interface

= Introduction =

The interface should support:
  # basic browsers
  # desktop browsers (with AJAX)
  # mobile/low-resolution browsers
  # REST clients

= Details =

The plan is to use progressive enhancement, except allow ourselves to break clients older than ourselves.

Appearance:
  # basic form
  # style the page
  # AJAX and animations

Internals:
  # HTML form interface (through POST)
  # provide second RESTful interface for use with AJAX
  # possibly use `cherrypy-jsonrpcserver` and JSON-RPC if we're feeling ambitious
