#summary Installing Myro on Linux within the project directory

= Introduction =

Myro requires packages like old Python and threaded Tcl/Tk.


= Details =

The development setup includes:
  * custom Python and Tcl/Tk builds
  * old modules
  * wrapper script for Python

For development, the simulator will be launched. Beeps will be printed to the server console.

You will need:
  * make, gcc, etc.
  * numpy, etc.
  * 250 MB free space
  * network

Instructions:
  # In `lib/`, type `make`. After everything installs, you should get a Python prompt.
  # Run `simulator()` to see if the simulator starts.
  # Run `forward(1)`.
  # In the project root, type `make` to start the server. The simulator should automatically open. The default recipe should kill any existing simulators.
  # Edit interface.py and the server will automatically reload the code. Depending on your editor, the automatic reloading may occasionally fail due to a race condition, but this only happens during development.
